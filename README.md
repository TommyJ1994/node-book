Welcome to Learning Node.js . Node.js is an exciting new platform for writing network and web
applications that has created a lot of buzz over the past couple of years and rapidly gathered a
sizeable following in the developer community. In this book, I teach you more about it, why
it is special, and get you up and writing Node.js programs in short order. You’ll soon find that
people are rather flexible with the name of Node.js and will refer to it frequently as just Node
or even “node.” I certainly do a lot of that in this book as well.
